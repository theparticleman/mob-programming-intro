# Intro to Mob Programming

Mob programming is a collaborative software development practice, kind of like pair programming but turned up to 11. You can look [here](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mob-programming) for more details on mob programming. 

## How it works
There are a lot of different ways to do mob programming. Some will work better in some situations and others will work better in other situations. But in general, for mob programming the entire team or group works together on the same thing. When in person this typically happens using a single computer (or at least a single main, development computer). When remote each person will need their own computer but everyone is working on the code together. Some of the tools we'll use to do this during this session are described below.

During this mob programming session we'll have a dedicated driver and a dedicated navigator. Who is filling each of those roles will rotate on a timer. 

### Mob member
If you're not filling the role of driver or navigator you're still a member of the mob and are welcome and encouraged to contribute questions and ideas to help drive your solution forward. 

### Driver
If you are the driver it is your job to be an intelligent keyboard. You don't have to worry about deciding what code to write next. All you have to do is worry about turning instructions from the navigator into keystrokes. If you ever need more detail on what to actually type, feel free to ask. 

### Navigator
The job of the navigator is to tell the driver what code to write next. You need to give those instructions in a way that the driver can understand. That could be as high level as "make this code work" or as low level as telling them which keys to press. If you're not sure exactly what code the mob should work on next, feel free to ask the rest of the mob members.

## Tools
The tools you use during mob programming can make the experience more or less enjoyable. For this session we will all be distributed, which makes the tools we choose even more impactful.

### Zoom and Slack
Each mob will go to their own Zoom breakout room. The moderator will take care of creating these rooms and assigning people to them. The only thing you should have to worry about is clicking a button saying you want to go to the breakout room. In the breakout room you should be able to communicate face to face with the rest of your group. If at any point you get lost and can't communicate on Zoom, feel free to ask for help in the 

### Visual Studio Code + Live Share
For this session we'll use Visual Studio Code with the Live Share extension. Visual Studio Code is free and works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can find downloads [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Once you have Visual Studio Code downloaded and installed you'll need to install the Live Share extension. Once you're installed the Live Share extension you'll need either a Microsoft account or a Github account to sign in and use it.

One person in each mob will start a Live Share session and send a link to everyone else in the mob.

### Programming language
The programming problem we'll be working on for this session can be completed in pretty much any programming language. However, making sure that everyone has the tooling necessary to use any programming language is a bit beyond the scope of this session. It is recommended that you use Javascript (Node JS) or C# for this session. But if everyone in your group agrees to a programming language other than those two, and the person hosting the Live Share session is okay installing the necessarily tooling, then feel free to use a different language. Do make sure to take into account the impact that tool setup will have on the amount of time you have to work on the problem.

### Timer
Since who is filling each role changes over time, we need a timer to keep track or when to switch roles. For that we'll be using a remote mob timer. It is web based and everyone can use it at the same time to see the timer.

One of the first things you'll want to do is add the names of everyone in your group to the mob timer.

### Version control
Version control is always a great idea. Discuss with your fellow mob members if you want to use version control for this session, even if it's just a local repo.
